<a name = 'howtoplay'><h2>How to play Jotto</h2></a>
Jotto is a word guessing game. The goal is to guess another player's secret 5-letter word.
After each guess, if the correct word was not guessed, the other player responds
with the number of letters in the guess that match the secret word. The position
does not matter, but duplicates do count. For example:
<table align = 'center' border = '1'>
<thead>
<th>Secret word</th>
<th>Guess word</th>
<th>Matching letters</th>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>boost</td>
<td>defer</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>raise</td>
<td>roast</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>feeds</td>
<td>freed</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rated</td>
<td>tread</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
</table>
<a name = 'usage'><h2>Using the program</h2></a>
The program will try to guess the user's secret word. Start by loading a list of 5 letter words. One is provided
in folder "jotto/resources/" Or a custom list can be loaded. The words are processed, and a Jotto file is built.
You can save this file for faster loading of words next time.<p>
After the words are compiled, press "Start!" to begin the game.<p>
The program will guess a word, and the user clicks the number of matching letters or "That's it!" if 
the secret word is guessed. This process repeats until the program guesses the right word, or
it determines that it doesn't know the user's word.

At each step of the guessing game, the program selects the word that maximizes the entropy
from the partitioning of words based on the number of matching letters. This is the next guess.
